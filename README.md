I have created this project in order to apply what I have learnt until now about Git, HTML and the terminal commands.
1. Created all the folders and files and moved trough them using terminal commands
2. I have used HTML elements like paragrahps, images, headers, absolute links and relative ones and their attributes.
3. Tried to improve my usage of Git commands and messages
